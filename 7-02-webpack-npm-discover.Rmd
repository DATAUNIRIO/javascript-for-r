# Discover Webpack and NPM {#webpack-intro-discover}

In this chapter we discover how to feature webpack and NPM in a very simple shiny project, the idea is not to build a complex application, only to discover how one might go about bringing them into an R project and observe some of their benefits.

We see later how another R package can greatly ease much of what we're about to uncover here, but before we do so it's essential we have a good understanding of how it works.

## Installation {#webpack-intro-install}

NPM being Node's package manager it requires a working installation of node.js, NPM ships with it. A bit like R in a sense, the package manager comes with the language, install R and you can install packages from CRAN with `install.packages`, the same applies here, install Node.js and you can install packages from NPM from the command line.

```{block, type='rmdnote'}
We are only going to use Node.js indirectly, some of its functionalities and its package manager.
```

Below are some directions on how to install node.js, in the event this does not work or you encounter issues please refer to the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Mac OS {#webpack-intro-install-mac}

On Mac OS, the easiest way is via homebrew.

```
brew update
brew install node
```

Otherwise there is also an [installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) available.

### Ubuntu {#webpack-intro-install-ubuntu}

With Ubuntu one can install it straight from the package manager.

```
sudo apt install nodejs
```

### Windows {#webpack-intro-install-windows}

Download and install the official [executable](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

```
cinst nodejs
# or for full install with npm
cinst nodejs.install
```

Or use [scoop](https://scoop.sh/).

```
scoop install nodejs
```

### Other {#webpack-intro-install-other}

If you are on another OS or Linux distro check the official, very concise [guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install from various package managers.

## Setup {#webpack-intro-setup}

Let us first put together a simple shiny application that which will serve as a basis for including webpack and npm. Create a new directory and place a file called `app.R` containing a very simple application.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  h1("A shiny app")
)

server <- function(...) {}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
