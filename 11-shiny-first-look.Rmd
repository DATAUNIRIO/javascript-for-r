# A First Look - Alerts

Making shiny work with JavaScript can essentially be broken down into two operations: 1) passing data from the R server to the JavaScript client and 2) the other way around, from the client to the R server. This chapter covers both ways data travels between R and JavaScript in Shiny.

We first build an application that passes a message from the R server to the client to display said message as a vanilla JavaScript alert (pop-up), then send back to the R server whether the user has clicked "OK" on the alert. Let's write a straightforward shiny application which includes the JavaScript code that opens an alert.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "alert('Hello from JavaScript');"
  ),
  h1("Hello")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

One thing important to note for later is that alerts will always block the execution of code which allows making sure some code is only run with user consent or the user being aware of the consequences.

```js
alert('delete everything?');
deleteEverythingOnlyIfUserOK();
```

## From R to JavaScript {-}

Now that we have a simple alert displayed in the application we can tie it with our R server; the alert should display a message sent by the R server, this would enable, for instance, displaying a message taken from a database or a user input. As might be expected there are two functions required to do so, an R function and its JavaScript complementary: one to send the data from the server and another to catch said data from the client and display the alert. 

Let us start by writing the R code to send the data, thankfully very little is required of the developer. One can send data from the R server to the client from the `session` object using the `sendCustomMessage` method. The method takes two arguments, first an identifier (where to send the data to), second the actual data to send to JavaScript.  

```r
server <- function(input, output, session){
  # set the identifier to send-alert
  session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = "Hi there!")
}
```

This effectively sends our message to the JavaScript client but we are yet to use that message JavaScript-side so the application still displays the same alert on load. We can add a "handler" for the identifier we defined (`send-alert`) which will so something with the message we sent from the server. This is done with the `addCustomMessageHandler` method from the `Shiny` object where the first argument is the identifier and the second is the function that handles the message, generally a function that takes a single argument: the data sent from the server. 

```r
tags$script(
  "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
    alert(message);
  });"
)
```

This enables you to pass a message that is taken from a database for instance, or as shown below from a user input, to the alert.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      alert(message);
    });"
  ),
  h1("Hello"),
  textInput("text", "Text to show in alert"),
  actionButton("submit", "Show alert")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  observeEvent(input$submit, {
    session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = input$text)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

In the application above, notice the path that our message follows: it goes from the client to the server which sends it back to the client. This might be considered suboptimal by some as it is not necessary to use the server as intermediary (in this example at least). Though there is some truth to this the above will work perfectly fine---and our aim here is to make JavaScript work with R---not alongside it.

## From JavaScript to R {-}

Imagine if you will that instead of displaying a somewhat anodyne alert it was one that actually mattered where the user is warned that clicking "OK" will execute an irreversible action like the deletion of a record. In order to implement this the server would need to "know" whether the user has clicked said "OK" button. To do so one needs to pass data from the client to the server.

This can be done by defining a new _simplified_ shiny input. While one can define a fully-fledged shiny input that can be registered, updated, etc. there is also a simplified version of the latter which allows sending reactive input value to the server where it can be used just like any other inputs (`input$id`). The value of the input can be defined using the `setInputValue` method which takes the id of the input and the value to give it.

```r
tags$script(
  "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
    
    // show alert
    alert(message);

    // set to true when clicked OK
    Shiny.setInputValue('delete_alert', true);
  });"
)
```

As mentioned earlier `alert` blocks code execution, therefore the input value will not be defined before the button "OK" is pressed. The server can now access the `input$delete_alert` input which is by default `NULL` and set to `TRUE` when the user has pressed "OK," as done in the application below which prints the input to the console when the button is clicked.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      alert(message);
      Shiny.setInputValue('delete_alert', true);
    });"
  ),
  h1("Hello")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = "Deleting a record!")

  observeEvent(input$delete_alert, {
    # print TRUE when button is clicked
    print(input$delete_alert) 
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Note that Shiny performs optimisations on how those values are set. First, if the input is set to the same value then Shiny ignores it. This is fine if you are interested in the actual value of the input but will not work as expected if the input is to be used as event. Indeed if you want to use this input in an `observe`, `observeEvent`, or `eventReactive`, you want it to be triggered every time the input changes, regardless of whether that value is the same as before. The second optimisation Shiny does is when the input is set to multiple different values before these have been processed then only the most recent value will actually be sent to the server. One can opt-out of these optimisations using the `priority: "event"` option when setting the input value.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      alert(message);
      Shiny.setInputValue('delete_alert', true, {priority: 'event'});
    });"
  ),
  h1("Hello")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = "Deleting a record!")

  observeEvent(input$delete_alert, {
    # print TRUE when button is clicked
    print(input$delete_alert) 
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
