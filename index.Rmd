# Preface {-}

The R programming language has seen the integration of many programming languages; C, C++, Python, to name a few, can be seamlessly embedded into R code. Little known to many, R works just as well with JavaScript---this book delves into the various ways both languages can work together.

The ultimate aim of this work is to put the reader at ease with inviting JavaScript in their data science workflow.
