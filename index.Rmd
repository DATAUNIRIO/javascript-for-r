# Preface {-}

The R programming language has seen the integration of many programming languages; C, C++, Python, to name a few, can be seamlessly embedded into R so one can easily call code written in other languages from the R console. Little known to many, R works just as well with JavaScript---this book delves into the various ways both languages can work together.

The ultimate aim of this work is to put the reader at ease with inviting JavaScript in their data science workflow. In that respect the book is not teaching one JavaScript but rather we show how little JavaScript can greatly support and enhance R code. Therefore focus is on integrating external JavaScript libraries and no prior knowledge of JavaScript is required. Moreover, the book focuses on generalisable learnings so the reader can transfer takeaways from the book to solve real-world problems.

Throughout the book several R packages are built as examples, all of these, along with the code for the entire book can be found on the Github repository: [github.com/JohnCoene/javascript-for-r](https://github.com/JohnCoene/javascript-for-r).

## Premise {-}

The R programming language has been propelled into web browsers with the introduction of packages such as [shiny](@R-shiny) and [rmarkdown](@R-rmarkdown). Yet most R developers are not familiar with one of web browsers core technology: JavaScript. This books aims to remedy to that by demonstrating how _basic knowledge_ of the language can lead to huge realisations otherwise locked away from R developers.

The book is nonetheless not about learning JavaScript, even though it is aimed at R developers with no prior knowledge of the language. This statement might appear counterintuitive at first but, we hope, the book gradually reveals just how little JavaScript is actually needed in order to observe immense benefits numerous data science-related applications.

## Book Structure {-}

1. The book opens with an introduction to better understand its premise. It starts with rationales for using JavaScript in conjunction with R which are supported with existing R packages that already make use of JavaScript and are available on CRAN. Then we briefly describe concepts essential to understand the rest of the book so the reader can follow along. Finally, the chapter closes by listing the various methods with which one might make JavaScript work with R.

2. Then we delve into using JavaScript for computations, namely via the V8 engine and node.js. After a short introduction, chapters will walk the reader through various examples: a fuzzy search, a time format converter, and a basic natural language tokenizer.

3. The third part of the book details how JavaScript can work with Shiny. Once the basics out of the way, we build utilities to display notifications. Then we create a functionality to notify the user when the shiny server is busy running computations. This part of the book ends with an example of custom shiny output for a library that applies filters to images.

4. The largest part of the book concerns data visualisation, it plunges into creating interactive outputs with the htmlwidgets and shiny packages. This opens with a brief overview of how it works and libraries that make great candidates to integrate with the htmlwidgets package. Then a first widget is built, a rather unimpressive one, but it immensely useful to look under the hood of such outputs to observe its inner-workings and grasp a better understanding of how htmlwidgets work. Then a second package is built, one that allows to mimic text being typed. Next, we tackle a more substantial library that allows drawing arcs between countries on a 3D globe. The last two chapters go into more advanced topics such as security and resizing as well as how such interactive visualisations can work hand in hand with the shiny framework.

5. Finally the book closes with examples of all the integrations explored previously. This involves recreating (a part of) the plotly package, building an image classifier, adding progress bars to a shiny application, building a math evaluator and running basic machine learning operations in JavaScript.
