# Preface {-}

The R programming language has seen the integration of many programming languages; C, C++, Python, to name a few, can be seamlessly embedded into R so one can easily call code written in other languages from the R console. Little known to many, R works just as well with JavaScript---this book delves into the various ways both languages can work together.

The ultimate aim of this work is to put the reader at ease with inviting JavaScript in their data science workflow. In that respect the book is not teaching one JavaScript but rather we show how little JavaScript can greatly support and enhance R code. Therefore focus is on integrating external JavaScript libraries and no prior knowledge of JavaScript is required.

Throughout the book several R packages are built as examples, all of these, along with the code for the entire book can be found on the Github repository: [github.com/JohnCoene/javascript-for-r](https://github.com/JohnCoene/javascript-for-r).
