# (PART) Web Development with Shiny {-}

# Introduction to Shiny

Shiny is the web framework of choice for the R programming language. Since JavaScript and Shiny both run in web browsers it follows that they can run alongside one another as one can include JavaScript in such applications. Yet, often disregarded is the ability for Shiny's R server to communicate to the front-end and vice versa. This collection of chapters aims to show precisely how this works. In this first part, we brush up on the essentials so we understand how to include JavaScript in shiny applications.

Then again, the goal is not to write a lot of convoluted JavaScript, on the contrary, with little knowledge of the language the aim is to write as little as possible but demonstrate to the reader that it is often enough to greatly improve the user experience of shiny applications.

## Websocket & Shiny

Shiny applications have two components the user interface (UI) and the server function. These two components communicate via a websocket: a persistent connection that allows passing messages between the server and clients connecting to it. In the R server this connection is managed by shiny using the httpuv [@R-httpuv] and websocket [@R-websocket] packages, while in clients connecting to the server this connection is managed with JavaScript.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.dim=c(3, 6)}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph{
  node [shape=record fontsize=10];

  w1 [label=Websocket];
  w2 [label=Websocket];
  w3 [label=Websocket];
  w4 [label=Websocket];

  b1 [label='Browser' color=gold];
  b2 [label='Browser' color=gold];
  b3 [label='Browser' color=gold];
  b4 [label='Browser' color=gold];

  s [label='R server' color=royalBlue];

  s -> w1 -> b1 [dir=both color=dimGray arrowsize=.3];
  s -> w2 -> b2 [dir=both color=dimGray arrowsize=.3];
  s -> w3 -> b3 [dir=both color=dimGray arrowsize=.3];
  s -> w4 -> b4 [dir=both color=dimGray arrowsize=.3];

}
")
```

With that in mind we can put together a shiny applications which though simple exploits bi-directional communication. The application takes a text input, sends the value of the input to the R server which sends it back to the UI.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("nameInput", "Your name"),
  textOutput("nameOutput")
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$nameOutput <- renderText({
    input$nameInput
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Drawing a diagram of the communication between the UI and the server reveals that thought this is a simple application a lot is happening.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.dim=c(3, 6)}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph {
  graph[rankdir=LR fontsize = 10]
  node[shape=record fontsize = 9]

  subgraph cluster_0 {
    textInput
    textOutput
    label='User Interface'
    color=gold
  }

  subgraph cluster_1 {
    'input list'
    renderOutput
    label='R server'
    color=royalBlue
  }

  textInput -> 'input list' [xlabel=websocket fontsize = 8]
  'input list' -> renderOutput
  renderOutput -> textOutput [label=websocket fontsize = 8]
}
")
```

Communicating between the R server and the user interface requires JavaScript and thus makes us a reasonable chunk of this part of the book on web development with shiny.

## Alerts, An Example 

Making shiny work with JavaScript can essentially be broken down into two operations: 1) passing data from the R server to the JavaScript client and 2) the other way around, from the client to the R server. This chapter covers both ways data travels between R and JavaScript in Shiny.

We first build an application that passes a message from the R server to the client to display said message as a vanilla JavaScript alert (pop-up), then send back to the R server whether the user has clicked "OK" on the alert. Let's write a straightforward shiny application which includes the JavaScript code that opens an alert.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "alert('Hello from JavaScript');"
  ),
  h1("Hello")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

One thing important to note for later is that alerts will always block the execution of code which allows making sure some code is only run with user consent or the user being aware of the consequences.

```js
alert('delete everything?');
deleteEverythingOnlyIfUserOK();
```

## From R to JavaScript 

Now that we have a simple alert displayed in the application we can tie it with the R server; the alert should display a message sent by the R server, this would enable, for instance, displaying a message taken from a database or a user input. As might be expected there are two functions required to do so, an R function and its JavaScript complementary: one to send the data from the server and another to catch said data from the client and display the alert. 

Let us start by writing the R code to send the data, thankfully very little is required of the developer. One can send data from the R server to the client from the `session` object using the `sendCustomMessage` method. The method takes two arguments, first an identifier (where to send the data to), second the actual data to send to JavaScript.  

```r
server <- function(input, output, session){
  # set the identifier to send-alert
  session$sendCustomMessage(
    type = "send-alert", message = "Hi there!"
  )
}
```

This effectively sends the message to the JavaScript client but we are yet to use that message JavaScript-side so the application still displays the same alert on load. We can add a "handler" for the identifier we defined (`send-alert`) which will so something with the message we sent from the server. This is done with the `addCustomMessageHandler` method from the `Shiny` object where the first argument is the identifier and the second is the function that handles the message, a function that takes a single argument: the data sent from the server. 

```r
tags$script(
  "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(
    type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      alert(message);
  });"
)
```

![Alert sent from shiny server](images/alert-shiny.png)

This enables you to pass a message that is taken from a database for instance, or as shown below from a user input, to the alert.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(
      type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
        alert(message);
    });"
  ),
  h1("Hello"),
  textInput("text", "Text to show in alert"),
  actionButton("submit", "Show alert")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  observeEvent(input$submit, {
    session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = input$text)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

In the application above, notice the path that the message follows: it goes from the client to the server which sends it back to the client. This might be considered suboptimal by some as it is not necessary to use the server as intermediary (in this example at least). Though there is some truth to this the above will work perfectly fine---and the aim here is to make JavaScript work with R---not alongside it.

## From JavaScript to R 

Imagine if you will that instead of displaying a somewhat anodyne alert it was one that actually mattered where the user is warned that clicking "OK" will execute an irreversible action like the deletion of a record. In order to implement this the server would need to "know" whether the user has clicked said "OK" button. To do so one needs to pass data from the client to the server.

This can be done by defining a _simplified_ shiny input. While one can define a fully-fledged shiny inputs that can be registered, updated, etc. there is also a simplified version of the latter which allows sending reactive input values to the server where it can be used just like any other inputs (`input$id`). The value of the input can be defined using the `setInputValue` method which takes the id of the input and the value to give it.

```r
tags$script(
  "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(
    type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
    
      // show alert
      alert(message);

      // set to true when clicked OK
      Shiny.setInputValue('delete_alert', true);
  });"
)
```

As mentioned earlier `alert` blocks code execution, therefore the input value will not be defined before the button "OK" is pressed. The server can now access the `input$delete_alert` input which is by default `NULL` and set to `TRUE` when the user has pressed "OK," as done in the application below which prints the input to the console when the button is clicked.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(
      type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
        alert(message);
        Shiny.setInputValue('delete_alert', true);
    });"
  ),
  h1("Hello")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  session$sendCustomMessage(
    type = "send-alert", message = "Deleting a record!"
  )

  observeEvent(input$delete_alert, {
    # print TRUE when button is clicked
    print(input$delete_alert) 
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Note that Shiny performs optimisations on how those values are set. First, if the input is set to the same value then Shiny ignores it. This is fine if you are interested in the actual value of the input but will not work as expected if the input is to be used as event. Indeed if you want to use this input in an `observe`, `observeEvent`, or `eventReactive`, you want it to be triggered every time the input changes, regardless of whether that value is the same as before. The second optimisation Shiny does is when the input is set to multiple different values before these have been processed then only the most recent value will actually be sent to the server. One can opt-out of these optimisations using the `priority: "event"` option when setting the input value.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(
      type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
        alert(message);
        Shiny.setInputValue('delete_alert', true, {priority: 'event'});
    });"
  ),
  h1("Hello")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  session$sendCustomMessage(
    type = "send-alert", message = "Deleting a record!"
  )

  observeEvent(input$delete_alert, {
    # print TRUE when button is clicked
    print(input$delete_alert) 
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

## Deserialise 

In the section on sending data from R to JavaScript we used a "message handler" in JavaScript to handle the data coming from the server. There is also the corollary, an "input handler" to preprocess the data coming from JavaScript before it is made accessible by the input. In R, this is a function that must accept three arguments, the data coming JavaScript, a shiny session, and the name of the input. Note that all of these arguments are mandatory even if they are used in the function.

Input handlers are most often used to reshape or change the type of the data coming in. To demonstrate how use them, we create a handler for the `delete_alert` which adds somewhat useless meta information to the data.

```r
# create handler
process_input <- function(x, session, inputname){
  data <- list(
    data = x,
    meta = "This is some meta-data"
  )
  return(data)
}
```

Once this function created it needs to be registered with shiny using the `registerInputHandler` function which takes two arguments. First, a unique identifier for the handler, second, the handler function. Attempt to give the handler a unique yet simple name (alphanumeric characters, underscores, and periods) to avoid clashes with other handlers. 

```r
# register with shiny
registerInputHandler("alert.processor", process_input)
```

Note that handlers can only be registered once, running the above twice will fail the second time, even if the handler function has changed. Thus, the handler can be overwritten by setting `force` to `TRUE`. 

```r
# register with shiny
registerInputHandler("alert.processor", process_input, force = TRUE)
```

Once the handler function created and registered with shiny what is left to do is tell shiny which input should use that handler. This is done by adding the name of the handler, `alert.processor`, preceded by a colon (`:alert.processor`) as a suffix to the input name.

```js
Shiny.setInputValue('delete_alert:alert.processor', true, {priority: 'event'});
```

We can then recap to see what the application would look like now.

```r
library(shiny)

# create handler
process_input <- function(x, session, inputname){
  data <- list(
    data = x,
    meta = "This is some meta-data"
  )
  return(data)
}

# register with shiny
registerInputHandler("alert.processor", process_input)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(
      type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
        alert(message);
        Shiny.setInputValue(
          'delete_alert:alert.processor', true, 
          {priority: 'event'}
        );
    });"
  ),
  h1("Hello")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  session$sendCustomMessage(
    type = "send-alert", message = "Deleting a record!"
  )

  observeEvent(input$delete_alert, {
    print(input$delete_alert) 
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```
## $data
## [1] TRUE
## 
## $meta
## [1] "This is some meta-data"
```

The previous section on the input handler is entirely optional but as we will see in later parts of the book it can be nice touch in some cases.
