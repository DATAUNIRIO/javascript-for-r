# Packer Advanced {#packer-adv}

## Widgets {#packer-adv-widgets}

The widget scaffold, like all other scaffolds must be run from within the root of a package. To demonstrate we'll write a widget for the [countup](https://github.com/inorganik/countUp.js/) library that allows animating numbers.

```r
usethis::create_package("countup")
```

From the root of the package we scaffold the widget with `scaffold_widget`, which prints out some information on what packer exactly does. 

```r
packer::scaffold_widget("countup")
```

```
── Scaffolding widget ──────────────────────────────── countup ── 
✔ Bare widget setup
✔ Created srcjs directory
✔ Initialiased npm
✔ webpack, webpack-cli, webpack-merge installed with scope dev
✔ Created srcjs/config directory
✔ Created webpack config files
✔ Created srcjs/modules directory
✔ Created srcjs/widgets directory
✔ Created srcjs/index.js
✔ Moved bare widget to srcjs
✔ Added npm scripts

── Adding files to '.gitignore' and '.Rbuildignore' ──

✔ Setting active project to '/Projects/countup'
✔ Adding '^srcjs$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '^node_modules$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '^package\\.json$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '^package-lock\\.json$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '^webpack\\.dev\\.js$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '^webpack\\.prod\\.js$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding '^webpack\\.common\\.js$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Adding 'node_modules' to '.gitignore'

── Adding packages to Imports ──

✔ Adding 'htmlwidgets' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION
● Refer to functions with `htmlwidgets::fun()`

── Scaffold built ──

ℹ Run `bundle` to build the JavaScript files
```

Importantly, it runs `htmlwidgets::scaffoldWidget` internally.
