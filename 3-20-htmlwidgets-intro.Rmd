# (PART) Data Visualisation {-}

# Introduction to widgets

This part of the book explores the integration of JavaScript with R using the htmlwidgets package which focuses on libraries that produce a visual output, it is often used for data visualisation but is not limited to it.

As in previous parts of this book we mainly learn through examples, building multiple widgets of increasing complexity as we progress through the chapter. Before writing the first widget, we explore existing R packages that allow creating interactive data visualisations this give a first glimpse at we build in this part of the book. Then we explore JavaScript libraries that make great candidates for htmlwidgets and attempt to understand how they work to grasp what is expected from the developer in order to integrate them with R. Finally, we build up on the previous chapter to improve how htmlwidgets work with shiny.

The htmlwidgets package originates from the rCharts [@R-rCharts] package created in 2012 by Ramnath Vaidyanathan. It brough together a plethora of data visualisation JavaScript libraries, datamaps, highcharts, morris.js, and many more. Though no longer maintained, two years later, in 2014 Ramnath, Joe Cheng (RStudio CTO), and J.J. Allaire (RStudio CEO) start working on htmlwidgets.

## Plotly package

The plotly [@R-plotly] R package is probably one of the first and the most popular widget thus far. 

Plotly.js is a substantial library that provides over 40 chart types, including 3D charts, statistical graphs, and maps, all of which are available from the R interface, there is in fact so much depth to plotly that there is an entire [book](https://plotly-r.com/) on the topic.
