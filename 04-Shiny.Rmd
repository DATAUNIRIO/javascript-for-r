# (PART) Development with Shiny {-}

# Shiny

Shiny is by far most popular, if not the only, web framework for the R programming language. In this chapter, after brushing up on the necessary to include JavaScript in shiny applications, we explore how to blend the JavaScript language with our R server and front-end.

Then again, the aim is not to write a lot of convoluted JavaScript, on the contrary, it is to write as little as possible and demonstrate to the reader that it is often enough to greatly improve the user experience of shiny applications. Making shiny work with JavaScript can essentially be broken down into two operations: 1) passing data from the R server to the JavaScript client and 2) the other way around, from the client to the R server.

In this chapter every section builds upon the previous, only skip those if you truly feel confident you understand it fully or you will quickly get confused.

## Static Files {-}

In order to introduce JavaScript to shiny applications one must understand static files and how they work with the framework. Static files are files that are downloaded by the clients, in this case web browsers accessing shiny applications, as-is, these generally include images, CSS (`.css`), and JavaScript (`.js`).

If you are familiar with R package development, static files are to shiny applications what the "inst" directory is to an R package, those files are installed as-is and do not require further processing as opposed to the "src" folder which contains files that need compiling for instance.

There are numerous ways to run a shiny application locally; the two most used probably are `shinyApp` and `runApp`. The RStudio IDE comes with a convenient "Run" button when writing a shiny application, which when clicked actually uses the function `shiny::runApp` in the background, this function looks for said static files in the `www` directory and makes them available at the same path (`/www`). If you are building your applications outside of RStudio, you should either also use `shiny::runApp` or specify the directory which then allows using `shiny::shinyApp`. Note that this only applies locally, shiny server (community and pro) as well as [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) use the same defaults as the RStudio IDE and `shiny::runApp`.

In order to ensure the code in this book can run regardless of the reader's machine or editor, the asset directory is always specified explicitly. This is probably advised to steer clear of the potential headaches as, unlike the default, it'll work regardless of the environment. If you are using [golem](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) [@R-golem] to develop your application then you should not worry about this as it specifies the directory internally.

Below we build a basic shiny application, however, before we define the ui and server we use the `shiny::addResourcePath` function to specify the location of the directory of static files that will be served by the server and thus accessible by the client. This function takes two arguments, first the `prefix`, which is the path (URL) at which the assets will be available, second the path to the directory of static assets.

We thus create the "assets" directory and a JavaScript file called `script.js` within it.

```r
# run from root of app (where app.R is located)
dir.create("assets")
writeLines("console.log('Hello JS!');", con = "assets/script.js")
```

We can now use the `shiny::addResourcePath` to point to this directory. Generally the same name for the directory of static assets and prefix is used so as to avoid confusion, below we name them differently in order for the reader to clearly distinguish which is which.

```r
# app.R
library(shiny)

# serve the files
addResourcePath(
  # will be accessible at /files
  prefix = "files", 
  # path to our assets directory
  directoryPath = "assets"
)

ui <- fluidPage(
  h1("R and JavaScript")
)

server <- function(input, output){}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

If you then run the application and open it at the `/files/script.js` path (e.g.: `127.0.0.1:3000/files/script.js`) you should see the content of our JavaScript file (`console.log('Hello JS!')`), commenting the `addResourcePath` line will have a "Not Found" error displayed on the page instead.

```{block, class='important'}
All files in your asset directory will be served online and accessible to anyone: do not place sensitive files in it.
```

Though one may create multiple such directory and correspondingly use `addResourcePath` to specify multiple paths and prefixes, one will routinely specify a single one, named "assets" or "static," which contains multiple subdirectories, one for each type of static file to obtain a directory that looks something like the tree below. This is, however, an unwritten convention which is by no means forced upon the developer: do as you wish.

```
assets/
├── js/
│    └── script.js
├── css/
│    └── style.css
└── img/
     └── pic.png
```

At this stage we have made the JavaScript file we created accessible by the clients but we still have to source this file in our `ui` as currently this file is, though served, not used by our application. Were one creating a static HTML page one would use the `script` to `src` the file in the `head` of the page.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!–– source the JavaScript file ––>
    <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p id="content">Trying JavaScript!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In shiny we write the ui in R and not in HTML (though this is also supported). Given the resemblance between the names of HTML tags and shiny UI functions it's pretty straightforward, the html page above would look something like the shiny `ui` below. 

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(
    tags$script(src = "path/to/script.js")
  ),
  p(id = "content", "Trying JavaScript!")
)
```

Note that we use the `tags` object which comes from the shiny package and includes HTML tags that are not exported as standalone functions. For instance, you can create a `<div>` in shiny with the `div` function but `tags$div` will also work. This can now be applied to the shiny application, the `path/to/script.js` should be changed to `files/script.js` where `files` is the prefix we defined in `addResourcePath`.

```r
# app.R
library(shiny)

# serve the files
addResourcePath(prefix = "files", directoryPath = "assets")

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(
    tags$script(src = "files/script.js")
  ),
  h1("R and JavaScript")
)

server <- function(input, output){}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

From the browser, inspecting page (right click > inspect > console tab) one should see "Hello JS!" in the console which means our application correctly ran the code in our JavaScript file.

## Integration {-}

The following sections will walk you through an example in which one first starts with a basic hello-world-like JavaScript example running in shiny and ends with a fully-fledged R package that brings new functionalities to shiny by integrating a third party library.

We first build an application that passes a message from the R server to the client to display said message as a vanilla JavaScript alert (pop-up), then send back to the R server whether the user has clicked "OK" on the alert. Finally we replicate that but with an external library and wrap the whole project into a fully functional package.

First, let's write a barebone shiny application which includes the JavaScript code which opens an alert.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "alert('Hello from JavaScript');"
  ),
  h1("Hello")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

![JavaScript alert in shiny](images/alert.png)

One thing important to note for later is that alerts will always block the execution of code which allows making sure some code is only run with user consent or the user being aware of the consequences.

```js
alert('delete everything?');
deleteEverythingOnlyIfUserOK();
```

## From R to JavaScript {-}

Now that we have a simple alert displayed in the application we can tie it with our R server; the alert should display a message sent by the R server, this would enable, for instance, displaying a message taken from a database or a user input. As might be expected there are two functions required to do so, an R function and its JavaScript complementary: one to send the data from the server and another to catch said data from the client and display the alert. 

Let us start by writing the R code to send the data, thankfully very little is required of the developer. One can send data from the R server to the client from the `session` object using the `sendCustomMessage` method. The method takes two arguments, first an identifier (where to send the data to), second the actual data to send to JavaScript.  

```r
server <- function(input, output, session){
  # set the identifier to send-alert
  session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = "Hi there!")
}
```

This effectively sends our message to the JavaScript client but we are yet to use that message JavaScript-side so the application still displays the same alert on load. We can add a "handler" for the identifier we defined (`send-alert`) which will so something with the message we sent from the server. This is done with the `addCustomMessageHandler` method from the `Shiny` object where the first argument is the identifier and the second is the function that handles the message, generally a function that takes a single argument: the data sent from the server. 

```r
tags$script(
  "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
    alert(message);
  });"
)
```

![Alert sent from shiny server](images/alert-shiny.png)

This enables you to pass a message that is taken from a database for instance, or as shown below from a user input, to the alert.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      alert(message);
    });"
  ),
  h1("Hello"),
  textInput("text", "Text to show in alert"),
  actionButton("submit", "Show alert")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  observeEvent(input$submit, {
    session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = input$text)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

In the application above, notice the path that our message follows: it goes from the client to the server which sends it back to the client. This might be considered suboptimal by some as it is not necessary to use the server as intermediary (in this example at least). Though there is some truth to this the above will work perfectly fine---and our aim here is to make JavaScript work with R---not alongside it.

## From JavaScript to R {-}

Imagine if you will that instead of displaying a somewhat anodyne alert it was one that actually mattered where the user is warned that clicking "OK" will execute an irreversible action like the deletion of a record. In order to implement this the server would need to "know" whether the user has clicked said "OK" button. To do so one needs to pass data from the client to the server.

This can be done by defining a new _simplified_ shiny input. While one can define a fully-fledged shiny input that can be registered, updated, etc. there is also a simplified version of the latter which allows sending reactive input value to the server where it can be used just like any other inputs (`input$id`). The value of the input can be defined using the `setInputValue` method which takes the id of the input and the value to give it.

```r
tags$script(
  "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
    
    // show alert
    alert(message);

    // set to true when clicked OK
    Shiny.setInputValue('delete_alert', true);
  });"
)
```

As mentioned earlier `alert` blocks code execution, therefore the input value will not be defined before the button "OK" is pressed. The server can now access the `input$delete_alert` input which is by default `NULL` and set to `TRUE` when the user has pressed "OK," as done in the application below which prints the input to the console when the button is clicked.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      alert(message);
      Shiny.setInputValue('delete_alert', true);
    });"
  ),
  h1("Hello")
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = "Deleting a record!")

  observeEvent(input$delete_alert, {
    # print TRUE when button is clicked
    print(input$delete_alert) 
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## External Library {-}

Thus far this chapter has covered both ways data travels between JavaScript and R in Shiny. However, the alerts displayed in the previous sections are rather hideous and, though demonstrates how both languages can work together within shiny, comes short of illustrating how to make use of external libraries, which is something frequently performed.

Let's exploit an external library to improve upon the work done so far: [jBox](https://github.com/StephanWagner/jBox) allows displaying modals (pop-ups), very similar to the vanilla JavaScript alerts, but much better looking and with additional functionalities.

The very first thing to do is to import jBox in our project, we could download the files and use them as described in the previous static files section but it comes with very convenient CDNs detailed in the [get-started page of the documentation](https://stephanwagner.me/jBox/get_started). 

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js"></script>
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Note that the "j" in jBox stands for jQuery which is already a dependency of shiny itself, there is therefore no need to import it, on the contrary one should not in order to avoid clashes. We can adapt the ui of the shiny application built up to this point to import the dependencies, keeping the handler, to obtain the code below.

```r
ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(
    tags$script(
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js"
    ),
    tags$link(
      rel="stylesheet",
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css"
    ),
    tags$script("Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      // TO DO: code jBox
    });")
  )
)
```

The jBox library comes with numerous features to display tooltips, modals, notices, and more, which would make for too long a chapter; only notices shall be covered here. Further down the [get-started document](https://stephanwagner.me/jBox/get_started#notices) lies an example of a jBox notice.

```js
new jBox('Notice', {
  content: 'Hurray! A notice!',
  color: 'blue'
});
```

Let us copy that in the placeholder of the shiny ui already put together.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(
    tags$script(
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js"
    ),
    tags$link(
      rel="stylesheet",
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css"
    ),
    tags$script("Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      new jBox('Notice', {
        content: 'Hurray! A notice!',
        color: 'blue'
      });
    });")
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session){
  session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = "Deleting a record!")
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

![First jBox Notice](images/notice-1.png)

With some minor changes the application can display the message passed, one only needs to replace 'Hurray! A notice!' with the `message` variable.

```r
tags$script("Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
  new jBox('Notice', {
    content: message,
    color: 'blue'
  });
});")
```

This though only allows passing a single variable, the message, to JavaScript but jBox has many more options.

## Serialisation {-}

Let's delve deeper into the communication between the server and the front-end to understand how we can further customise the notice displayed, e.g.: change the colour.

```js
{
  content: 'Hurray! A notice!',
  color: 'blue'
}
```

Notice that the jBox notice takes a JSON object containing the options that define said notice to display, including but not limited to the message. The most straightforward way to make all those options accessible to the server is to construct that list of options server-side before sending it to the the front-end. For instance the JSON of options displayed above would look like the R list below.

```r
list(
  content = 'Hurray! A notice!',
  color = 'blue'
)
```

Therefore one could construct this list server-side and use it in jBox straight away, without any further processing from the client. Doing so means we can simplify the JavaScript to `new jBox('Notice', message);` rather than use `message` within the JSON.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(
    tags$script(
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js"
    ),
    tags$link(
      rel="stylesheet",
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css"
    ),
    tags$script("Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      // use notice send from the server
      new jBox('Notice', message);
    });")
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session){

  # define notice options
  notice = list(
    content = 'Hello from the server',
    color = 'black'
  )

  # send the notice
  session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = notice)
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

![Customised jBox Notice](images/notice-2.png)

This sets a solid basis to further integrate other functionalities of jBox or any other JavaScript library one finds useful in Shiny.

## Events & Callbacks {-}

In the example of the vanilla JavaScript alert one could simply place a line of code after the `alert()` function in order to "tell" the server whether the button on the alert had been clicked. This was feasible because `alert` stops the execution of code, this is however rather uncommon in JavaScript. What is far more used are events or callback functions which are triggered upon an action is performed by the user (like the click of a button) or when other interesting things happen in the code (when something errors). [jBox provides numerous such events](https://stephanwagner.me/jBox/options#events): callback functions can be used when a modal is closed or when it is created for instance.

The concept of callback function is not totally foreign to R albeit rarely used. Shiny comes with such functions, e.g.: `shiny::onStop`. This allows having a function be triggered when the application exits (useful to close database connections for instance).

```r
server <- function(input, output){
  shiny::onStop(
    # callback function fired when app is closed
    function(){
      cat("App has been closed")
    } for instance
  )
}
```

In jBox, these callback functions are included in the JSON of options, below the `onClose` event is fired when the notice is closed.

```js
{
  content: 'Alert!',
  onClose: function(){
    // Fired when closed 
    console.log('Alert is closed');
  }
}
```

This raises one issue, one cannot truly serialise an object of type function (there are exceptions later in the book). The callback function must therefore be appended to the object of options in JavaScript.

```r
tags$script("Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
  // append callback
  message.onClose = function(){
    Shiny.setInputValue('alert_close', true);
  }
  new jBox('Notice', message);
});")
```

Placing a function inside a JSON object is common in JavaScript, in contrast with R where, though it works is rarely if ever done. The above JavaScript code to append the callback function could look something like the snippet below in R.

```{r}
message <- list(content = "hello")
message$onClose <- function(x){
  x + 1
}

message$onClose(2)
```

That done it can be incorporated into the application built thus far. Something interesting could be done server-side but for the sake of this example we merely print the value of the input to the R console.

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(
    tags$script(
      src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js"
    ),
    tags$link(
      rel="stylesheet",
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css"
    ),
    tags$script("Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler(type = 'send-alert', function(message) {
      message.onClose = function(){
        Shiny.setInputValue('alert_close', true);
      }
      new jBox('Notice', message);
    });")
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session){

  # define notice options
  notice = list(
    content = 'Hello from the server',
    color = 'black'
  )

  # send the notice
  session$sendCustomMessage(type = "send-alert", message = notice)

  # print the output of the alert_close event (when fired)
  observeEvent(input$alert_close, {
    print(input$alert_close)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## As a Package {-}

_If confused by any of the following please visit the [package development section](package-development) in the first chapter of this book._

Packages are a fundamental part of R and allow conveniently sharing code and we ought to take advantage of that for the functionality we have been building throughout this chapter. The work done so far is probably fitting for a single application but one should not have to reproduce all of that every time one wants to use jBox in a shiny application: we ought to wrap these functionalities into a handy package that we can use and reuse at will. Moreover, this will benefit from all the other advantages that R packages bring to code such as documentation, and tests.

Before delving into the essence of building the package let us think through what it should include. The application using jBox gives some indication as to what the package will look like: two functions, one directory. Indeed users of the package should be able to reproduce what is executed in the application, namely import dependencies (including the message handler) as well as send data to the JavaScript front-end. Finally, we shall provide, with the package, a static directory of dependencies to avoid relying on the CDNs as this ensures reproducibility (code hosted online by third-party might change and break the package).

Let's start by creating an R package, here we name it "jbox," after the JavaScript of the same name, partly because the author lacks creativity: feel free to name it however you want.

```r
usethis::create_package("jbox")
```

### Dependencies

The very first thing that is required are the dependencies, let's create a directory of static assets, download the jBox files. We create the directory "inst" as per the R package convention and within it create another to hold our assets. 

```r
# create directories
dir.create("inst/assets", recursive = TRUE)
```

The jBox files can be downloaded from the CDN and placed within the directory that was created above.

```r
# URLs of CDNs
js_dep <- "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.js"
css_dep <- "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/StephanWagner/jBox@v1.2.0/dist/jBox.all.min.css"

# download
download.file(js_dep, destfile = "./inst/assets/jBox.all.min.js")
download.file(css_dep, destfile = "./inst/assets/jBox.all.min.css")
```

This done one should obtain a directory that looks similar to the tree below (some files and folders omitted for brevity).

```bash
DESCRIPTION
R/
inst/
├── assets/
│    ├── jBox.all.min.js
│    └── jBox.all.min.css
```
