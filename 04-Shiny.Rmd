# Shiny

Shiny is by far most popular, if not the only, web framework for the R programming language. In this chapter, after brushing up on the necessary to include JavaScript in our applications, we explore how to blend the JavaScript language with our R back-end.

Then again, the aim is not to write a lot of convoluted JavaScript, on the contrary, it is to write as little as possible and demonstrate to the reader that it is often enough to greatly change the user experience of shiny applications. Making shiny work with JavaScript can essentially be broken down into two operations: 1) passing data from the R server to the JavaScript client and 2) the other way around, from the client to the R server.

## Static Files {-}

Let's first tackle how one introduces JavaScript in a shiny application; the file(s) need to be served and sourced in the application.

```{block, class='note'}
Static files generally include images, CSS (`.css`), and JavaScript (`.js`).
```

There are numerous ways to run a shiny application locally; the two most used ones are probably `shinyApp` and `runApp`. If you are using the RStudio IDE use the convenient "Run" button, know that RStudio uses the function `shiny::runApp` in the background, this function looks for said static files in the `www` directory and makes them available at the same path (`/www`). If you are building your applications outside of RStudio, you should either also use `shiny::runApp` or specify the directory which then allows simply using `shiny::shinyApp`. Note that this only applies locally, shiny server (community and pro) as well as [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) use the same defaults as the RStudio IDE.

In order to ensure the code in this book can run regardless of the reader's machine and IDE, the asset directory is always specified. This is probably advised to steer clear of the potential headaches as, unlike the default, it'll work regardless of the environment. If you are using [golem](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) [@R-golem] to develop your application then you should not worry about this, golem specifies the directory internally.

Below we build a basic shiny application, however, before we define the ui and server we use the `shiny::addResourcePath` function to specify a directory of static files that will be served by the server and thus accessible by the client. This function takes two arguments, first the `prefix`, which is essentially the path (URL) at which the assets will be available, second the path to the directory of static assets.

We thus create the directory and a JavaScript file called `script.js` within it.

```r
# run from root of app (where app.R is located)
dir.create("assets")
writeLines("var x = 3;", con = "assets/script.js")
```

We can now use the `shiny::addResourcePath` to point to this directory. Generally developers use the same name for the directory of static assets and prefix so as to avoid confusion, below we name them differently in order for the reader to clearly distinguish which is which.

```r
# app.R
library(shiny)

# serve the files
addResourcePath(prefix = "files", directoryPath = "assets")

ui <- fluidPage(
  h1("R and JavaScript")
)

server <- function(input, output){}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

If you then run the application and open it at the `/files/script.js` path (e.g.:127.0.0.1:3000/files/script.js) you should see the content of our JavaScript file (`var x = 3;`), commenting the `addResourcePath` line will have a "Not Found" error displayed on the page instead.

```{block, class='important'}
All files in your asset directory will be served online and accessible to anyone: do not place sensitive files in it.
```

Though one may create multiple such directory and correspondingly use `addResourcePath` to specify multiple paths and prefixes, developers will generally specify a single one, named "assets" or "static," which contains multiple subdirectories, one for each type of static asset file to obtain a directory that looks something like the tree below.

```
assets/
├── js/
│    └── script.js
├── css/
│    └── style.css
└── img/
     └── pic.png
```

At this stage we have made the JavaScript file we created accessible by the clients but we still have to source this file in our `ui`. Were one creating a static HTML page one would use the `script` to `src` the file in the `head` of the page.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <!–– source the JavaScript file ––>
    <script src="path/to/script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p id="content">Trying JavaScript!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In shiny we generally write the ui in R and not in HTML. Given the resemblance between the names of HTML tags and shiny UI functions it's pretty straightforward, the html page above would look something like the shiny `ui` below. 

```r
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(
    tags$script(src = "path/to/script.js")
  ),
  p(id = "content", "Trying JavaScript!")
)
```

Note that we use the `tags` object which comes with shiny and includes HTML tags that are not exported as standalone functions. For instance, you can create a `<div>` in shiny with the `div` function but `tags$div` will also work. This can now be applied to the shiny application, the `path/to/script.js` should be changed to `files/script.js` where `files` is the prefix we defined in `addResourcePath`.

```r
# app.R
library(shiny)

# serve the files
addResourcePath(prefix = "files", directoryPath = "assets")

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$head(
    tags$script(src = "files/script.js")
  ),
  h1("R and JavaScript")
)

server <- function(input, output){}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## From R to JavaScript {-}

The first thing we shall attempt to do is send data from the R server to the JavaScript client.   

We'll build upon the extremely basic application we have put together in the previous section.

```r
# app.R
library(shiny)

# serve the files
addResourcePath(prefix = "files", directoryPath = "assets")

ui <- fluidPage(
  textInput("text")
  actionButton("alert", "Show an alert!")
)

server <- function(input, output){
  observeEvent(input$alert, {
    session$sendCustomMessage("show_alert", list(text = input$text))
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## In Packages {-}
