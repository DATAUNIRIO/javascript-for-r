# (PART) Data Visualisation {-}

# HTML widgets

In this chapter we cover the integration of JavaScript with R using the htmlwidgets package, which focuses on libraries that produce a visual output. It is primarily used for data visualisation but is not limited to it.

As in previous chapters we mainly learn by example and build multiple widgets. We first go through some basic principles that must be understood before we actually start writing code, we then write a simple widget that allows animating text, then move on to others to progressively include more data and features, finally we build up on the previous chapter to improve how HTML widgets work with shiny.

## How it works~ish {-}

Imagine there is no such package as HTML widgets to help create interactive visualisations from R: how would one attempt to go about it?

An interactive visualisation using JavaScript will will be contained within an HTML document, therefore it would probably have to be created first. Secondly, the visualisation that is yet to be created likely relies on external libraries, these would need to be imported in the document. The document should also include an HTML element (e.g.: `<div>`) to host said visualisation. Then data would have to be serialised in R and embedded into the document where it should be read by JavaScript code that uses it to create the visualisation. Finally all should be managed to work seamlessly across R markdown, shiny, and other settings.

Thankfully the htmlwidgets package is there to handle most of this. Nonetheless, it is important to understand that these operations are undertaken (to some degree) by htmlwidgets as it greatly helps use the package.

Must remember when building HTML widgets:

- Import dependencies
- Create an html element to hold visualisation
- Serialise R data to JSON
- Handle JSON data to produce visualisation

## Scaffold {-}

With some understanding, albeit limited, of such widgets work internally one is ready to "scaffold" one and explore how it works. The way one sets up such a package is stunningly simple. Below we create a package named "playground" which will be used to explore functionalities of htmlwidgets. Though one could probably create widgets outside of an R package, it would not only serve to make things more complicated.

```r
create_package("playground")
```

Then, from the root of the package created, we scaffold widget which we call "play".

```r
htmlwidgets::scaffoldWidget("play")
```

This function puts together the minimalistic structure necessary to implement an HTML widget and opens `play.R`, `play.js` and `play.yaml` in the RStudio IDE or the default text editor. These files are named after the widget and form the core a widget. The R file contains core functions of the R API, namely the `play` function which creates the widget itself, and the `render*` and `*output` functions that handle the widget in the shiny server and UI respectively. The `.js` file contains JavaScript functions that actually generate the visual output. 

```r
devtools::document()
devtools::load_all()
```

It might be hard to believe, but at this stage one already has a fully functioning widget ready to use after documenting, and building the package. Indeed, the `play.R` file that that was created contains a function named "play" ·∫Åhich takes, amongst other arguments, a message.  

```r
play(message = "This is a widget!")
```

![First HTML widget](images/playground-1.png)

This displays the message in the RStudio "Viewer," or the your default browser which indicates that the function creates an HTML output, the ![](images/open-in-browser.png) button located in the top right of the RStudio "Viewer" will open the message in your default browser. Opening the output in the browser can prove very useful to look under the hood of the widgets for debugging.

## Deconstruct & Retrace {-}

With an out-of-the-box HTML widget package one can start exploring the internals to understand how it works. Let's start by retracing the path taken by the message written in R to its seemingly magical appearance in HTML. The `play` function previously used, takes the `message` wraps it into a list which is then used in `htmlwidgets::createWidget`.

```r
# forward options using x
x = list(
  message = message
)
```

Wrapping a string in a list might seem unnecessary but one will eventually add variables when building a more complex widget, starting with a list makes it easier to add them later on. 

The source code of the created (and rendered) output can be accessed in different ways:

- By opening the visualisation in your browser using the ![](images/open-in-browser.png) button located in the top right of the "Viewer," and in the browser right clicking on the message to select "Inspect,"
- By right-clicking on the message displayed in RStudio and selecting "Inspect element." 

![Part of the HTML generated by `play` function](images/playground-source.png)

The first thing the source code reveals is the element (`div`) created by the htmlwidgets package to hold the message, as well as the JSON object which contains, amongst other things, the `x` variable used in the `play` function.

```html
<div id="htmlwidget-c21cca0e76e520b46fc7" style="width:960px;height:500px;" class="play html-widget"></div>
```

The `div` created bears a randomly generated `id` which one can define when creating the widget using the `elementId` argument.

```r
play("This is another widget", elementId = "myViz")
```

This produces an HTML element with the specified `elementId` as HTML `id` in the `div`.

```html
<div id="myViz" style="width:960px;height:500px;" class="play html-widget"></div>
```

You will also notice that this affect the `script` tag below, the `data-for` attribute of which is also set to "myViz," this tells the script which widget the JSON it contains is to be used for.

```html
<script type="application/json" data-for="myViz">{"x":{"message":"This is a widget!"},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
```

This use of id may be not obvious at first, but one needs to be able to handle multiple widgets in a single R markdown document or shiny application, distinguishing between them and their respective data inputs is thus crucial. Inspecting the output also shows the dependencies imported, these are placed within the `head` HTML tags at the top of the page. 

![Header imports](images/playground-deps.png)

This effectively imports the `htmlwidgets.js` library as well as the `play.js` file, and were the visualisation depending on external libraries they would appear alongside those. Peaking inside the `play.js` file located at `inst/htmlwidgets/play.js` reveals the code below.

```js
// play.js
HTMLWidgets.widget({

  name: 'play',

  type: 'output',

  factory: function(el, width, height) {

    // TODO: define shared variables for this instance

    return {

      renderValue: function(x) {

        // TODO: code to render the widget, e.g.
        el.innerText = x.message;

      },

      resize: function(width, height) {

        // TODO: code to re-render the widget with a new size

      }

    };
  }
});
```

However convoluted this may appear at first do not let that intimate you. The `factory` function returns two functions, one of which, `resize`, is currently empty, let's therefore look at the other first: `renderValue`. The function takes an object `x` from which is takes a message that it uses as text (`innerText`) for object `el`. The object `x` passed to this function is actually the list of the same name that was build in the R function `play`! While in R one would access the `message` in list `x` with `x$message` in JavaScript to access the `message` in the JSON `x` one writes `x.message`, only changing the dollar sign to a dot. Let's show this perhaps more clearly by printing the content of `x`.

```js
console.log(x);
el.innerText = x.message;
```

We place `console.log` to print the content of `x` in the console, reload the package functions with `devtools::load_all` and use the function `play` again then explore the console from the browser.

![Console tab output](images/playground-console-x.png)

This displays the JSON object containing the message which eerily resembles the list created in R (`x = list(message = "This is a widget!")`). What one should take away from this is that data that needs to be communicated from R to the JavaScript function should be placed in the R list `x`.

Before we move on to other things one should also grasp a better understanding of the `el` object, which can also be logged.

```js
console.log(x);
console.log(el);
el.innerText = x.message;
```

![Console tab output](images/playground-console-el.png)

This displays the HTML element created by htmlwidgets and meant to hold the visualisation, or in this case, the message. If you are familiar with JavaScript, this is the element that would be returned by `document.getElementById`. This object allows manipulating the element in pretty much any way imaginable, change its position, its colour, its size, or, in this case, used to insert some text in it. What's more one can access attributes of the object just like a JSON array. Therefore one can log the `id` of the element.

```js
// print the id of the element
console.log(el.id);
el.innerText = x.message;
```

Making the modifications above and reloading the package, one can create a widget given a specific id and see it displayed in the console, e.g.: `play("hello", elementId = "see-you-in-the-console")`.

In attempt to become more at ease with this setup let us change something and play with the widget. Out-of-the-box htmlwidgets uses `innerText`, which does very much what it says on the tin, it places takes inside an element. JavaScript comes with another function akin to `innerText`, `innerHTML`, while the former only allows inserting text the former lets one insert any HTML.

```js
el.innerHTML = x.message;
```

After changing the `play.js` file as above, and re-loading the package, one can use arbitrary HTML as messages.

```r
play("<h1>Using HTML!</h1>")
```

![Widget output](images/playground-h1.png)

That makes for a great improvement which opens the door to many possibilities. However, the interface this provides is unintuitive. Albeit similar, R users are more familiar with shiny and htmltools [@R-htmltools] tags than HTML tags, e.g.: `<h1></h1>` translates to `h1()` in R. The package should allow users to use those instead of forcing them to collapse HTML content in a string. Fortunately, there is a very easy way to obtain the HTML from those functions: convert it to a character string.

```{r}
html <- shiny::h1("HTML tag")

class(html)

# returns string
as.character(shiny::h1("HTML tag"))
```

Implementing this in the `play` function will look like this.

```r
# forward options using x
x = list(
  message = as.character(message)
)
```

Reloading the package with `devtools::load_all` lets one use shiny tags as the message.

```r
play(shiny::h2("Chocolate is a colour", style = "color:chocolate;"))
```

![Using shiny tags](images/playground-color.png)

This hopefully provides some understanding of how htmlwidgets work internally and thereby helps building such packages. This section covered much of what happens under the hood, at the exception of the use of JavaScript dependencies, this will be tackled in the following section where we build another, more interesting widget, which uses an external dependency.

## Typed {-}

In this section we build a package called `typed`, which wraps the JavaScript library of the same name, [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) that mimics text being typed. This builds upon many things we explored in the playground package.

```r
usethis::create_package("typed")
htmlwidgets::scaffoldWidget("typed")
```

### Dependency {-}

Once the package created and the widget scaffold laid down we need to add the JavaScript dependency, without which nothing can move forward. The documentation in the README of typed.js states that it can be imported like so.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typed.js@2.0.11"></script>
```

First, we will download the dependency, which consists of a single JavaScript file, instead of using the CDN as this ultimately makes the package more robust. Below we place the dependency in a "typed" directory within the "htmlwidgets" folder.

```r
dir.create("./inst/htmlwidgets/typed")
cdn <- "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typed.js@2.0.11"
download.file(cdn, "./inst/htmlwidgets/typed/typed.min.js")
```

This produces a directory that looks like this:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DESCRIPTION
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NAMESPACE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ R
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ typed.R
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ inst
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ htmlwidgets
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ typed
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ typed.min.js
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ typed.js
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ typed.yaml
```

in htmlwidgets dependencies are specified in the `.yml` file located at `inst/htmlwidgets` which at first contains a commented template.

```yml
# (uncomment to add a dependency)
# dependencies:
#  - name:
#    version:
#    src:
#    script:
#    stylesheet:
```

Let's first uncomment those lines as instructed at the top of the file and fill it in.

```yml
dependencies:
  - name: typed.js
    version: 2.0.11
    src: htmlwidgets/typed
    script: typed.min.js
```

We remove the `stylesheet` entry as this package does not require any CSS files. The `src` specifies the path to the directory containing the scripts and stylesheets. This is akin to using the `system.file` function to return the full path to a file or directory within the package.

```r
devtools::load_all()
system.file("htmlwidgets/typed", package = "typed")                                         
#> "/home/me/packages/typed/inst/htmlwidgets/typed"
```

We should verify that this is correct by using the one R function the package features and check the source code of the output to verify that the typed.js is indeed imported. We thus run `typed("test")`, open the output in the browser (![](images/open-in-browser.png)) and look at the source code of the page (right click and select "View page source"). At the top of the page one should see `typed.min.js` imported, click the link to ensure it correctly points to the dependency.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8"/>
<style>body{background-color:white;}</style>
<script src="lib/htmlwidgets-1.5.1/htmlwidgets.js"></script>
<script src="lib/typed.js-2.0.11/typed.min.js"></script>
<script src="lib/typed-binding-0.0.0.9000/typed.js"></script>
...
```

### JavaScript {-}

On its [official website](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/), typed.js gives the following example. The JavaScript function `Typed` takes two arguments, first the selector, the element to hold the output, second a JSON of options to specify what is being typed and a myriad of other things. 

```js
var typed = new Typed('.element', {
  strings: ["First sentence.", "Second sentence."],
  typeSpeed: 30
});
```

Let's incorporate it in our package by replacing the content of the `renderValue` in `typed.js` with the above.

```js
...
renderValue: function(x) {

  var typed = new Typed('.element', {
    strings: ["First sentence.", "Second sentence."],
    typeSpeed: 30
  });

}
...
```

One could be tempted to run `devtools::load_all` but this will not work, namely because the function uses a selector that is will not return any object; it needs to be applied to the div created by the widget. As hinted at in the playground, the selector of the element created is accessible from the `el` object. As a matter of fact, we did log in the browser console the id of the created div taken from `el.id`. Therefore concatenating the pound sign and the element id produces the select to said element. (`.class`, `#id`)

```js
// typed.js
...
renderValue: function(x) {

  var typed = new Typed('#' + el.id, {
    strings: ["First sentence.", "Second sentence."],
    typeSpeed: 30
  });

}
...
```

This should therefore work, run `devtools::load_all` followed by `typed("whatever")` and the JavaScript animated text will appear! It's not of any use just yet as the options, included the text being typed is predefined: the package is currently not making any use the of the inputs passed from R. Below change the default strings to `x.message`.

```js
// typed.js
...
renderValue: function(x) {

  var typed = new Typed('#' + el.id, {
    strings: x.message,
    typeSpeed: 30
  });

}
...
```

This, however, will cause issues as the `strings` options expects and array (a vector) and not a single string.

```r
typed("does not work") # length =  1
typed(c("This", "will", "work")) # length > 1
```

One solution is to force the input into a list.

```r
# typed.R
x = list(
  message = as.list(message)
)
```

At this juncture the package works but there is a salient issue with the way we are handling options. Why build a list in R to reconstruct it in JavaScript manually? Since the data is serialised to JSON and that typed.js expects a JSON of options it is actually much cleaner to construct an R list that mirrors the JSON array and then use this in JavaScript.

For instance, renaming the `message` to `strings` effectively does this.

```r
# typed.R
x = list(
  strings = as.list(message)
)
```

This allows greatly simplifying the code JavaScript side, makes it much easier to add other options down the line, and will be much easier to maintain, debug, and understand.

```js
// typed.js
...
renderValue: function(x) {

  var typed = new Typed('#' + el.id, x);

}
...
```

One can now add more options from the R code without having to alter any of the JavaScript. Let us demonstrate with the `loop` option.

```r
typed <- function(message, loop = FALSE, width = NULL, height = NULL, elementId = NULL) {

  # forward options using x
  x = list(
    loop = loop,
    message = message
  )

  # create widget
  htmlwidgets::createWidget(
    name = 'typed',
    x,
    width = width,
    height = height,
    package = 'typed',
    elementId = elementId
  )
}
```

The full list of which is available in the [documentation of typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/#customization).
