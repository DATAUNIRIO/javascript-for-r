# (PART) Data Visualisation {-}

# Introduction to widgets

This part of the book explores the integration of JavaScript with R using the htmlwidgets package which focuses on libraries that produce a visual output, it is often used for data visualisation but is not limited to it.

As in previous parts of this book we mainly learn through examples, building multiple widgets of increasing complexity as we progress through the chapter. Before writing the first widget, we explore existing R packages that allow creating interactive data visualisations this give a first glimpse at we build in this part of the book. Then we explore JavaScript libraries that make great candidates for htmlwidgets and attempt to understand how they work to grasp what is expected from the developer in order to integrate them with R. Finally, we build up on the previous chapter to improve how htmlwidgets work with shiny.
